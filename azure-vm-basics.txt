# azure account -> tenant -> subcription -> resourse group
## tenant = azure AD or dirtory,unique representation of oraganization with in azure AD

## subcription = billing arrement between user and azure that user will pay for what he use
### we can have multiple subcription

## resource group = logical grouping of the resources
### ex. project1 resources can kept in resorce group
### one vm can be in one resourse group at a time
### can create multiple RG with in the subcrition



                     cloud shell
#  azure cli - for linux users
# azure powershell - for windows powershell users 
## we want to specify storage for it
## creating resourse group by 
# azure cli 
#$ az group create -n bashRG -l centralindia  
### -n for name , -l for location
            
                  azure arm
## azure resourse manager
## deploy and management service    
## deployment,modification,deletion etc are managed
## user request -> API -> ARM -> resourse provider (eg.compute,storeage,networking)
## ARM template - deployment as code
### write code -> submit to arm -> arm will provide as requeste/o

                 azure vm
# permanent ip
# vm types
## general purpose - a seriles
##high compute -
#creation of vm 
## names within bractes are example names 
## image 
@ pre installed  os and can select the flavours in market place
@ image has also small disk image which has 30gb of storage if not 127 gb for windows will be there
@ image has generation called gen1 (bios) and gen2 (UEFI)
## core 
@ no gui only command line interface

## size
@ dfine compute,ram,mememory etc capacity

inbound port
@ allow incoming traffic
for windows = RPD (3389)

# widows vm creation
viturval machine ->create -> subcription -> resource group (new rg) -> vm name (vm1) ->
-> region (central india) ->image (windows) -> size (b2ms) -> username (isaac) -> password (p@$Suu0rD) 
-> pubilc inbound (allow selected ports) -> select inbound ports (RDP 3389) => reviwe + create

# can see deployment process in overview
connect windows by 
connect -> RPD -> downloaded rdp ->open -> connect -> password

                    vm disks
max size of a single 32 tb

# three types of disks
os disk
@ containes the os
@ it represented by c drive in windows
@ it represented by /sda in linux
@ data stored in storage cluster (san)

temp disk
@ for tempravary files
@ it represented by e drive in windows
@ it represented by /sdb in linux
@ no need to pay 
@ cant modify the size
@ data stored in compute cluster 
@
data disk
@ disk for seperate data
@ addtional disk and can attach as data disk 
@ it represented by d drive in windows
@ it represented by /sdc in linux
@ data stored in storage cluster (san)

           based on performance disk
virtual hard disk(vhd) -> storge account -> storsge area network
storage area network
@ has hard disk drive (HDD), soild state drive SSD

standard HDD
@ vitrual hard disk from azure will go to standard HDD
standard SSD 
@ hybrid disk 
@small capacity for SSD and more of HDD for caching and improvinf the performance
premium SSD
@ vitrual hard disk from azure will go to standard SSD

change vm disk
vm portal -> disks (in left hand side) ->  disk name -> size + perforamance 
# can increase capasity and can change type
# cant reduce the size
iops
@ input/output operations per second
@ each read/write operation can be 1 io
@ how many  io can done in disk in the given minute is iops

throuput
@ mount of data send or recive in given minute
@ eg 50mbps

add data disk
vm portal -> disks (in left hand side) -> create and attach new disk
->disk name (file disk) -> storage type (standaerd hhd) -> size gb (10) -> save (on the top)
-> go back to vm ->run -> didkmgmt.ms -> ok -> wait and when you see new disk select it -> new simple volume ->next till end

# max no. of disk can be added is depend upon vm size
# attaching disk has no downtime
# increasing the disk has downtime

vm mode
# restart 
@ restarting the vm
@ allocations will be remain
@ nothing happend to vm
@ pay for vm,storage


#shuddown
@ vm will shoutdown
@ allocations will be remain
@ pay for vm,storage

#stop and deloocate
@ stop and deallocate compute resources
@ temp disk will deallocated and data in it will lost
@ only pay for storage (cost saving)
@ os disk and data disk will remain same
@ when we start vm may create in other hardware


for testing 
# create windows vm 
# log in
# add a file in c drive(os disk) ,in e drive (data disk), in d drive (temp disk)
   # shutdown now 
   @ same pubilc ip
   @ status was stopped
   @ vm still allocated
   @ at start of vm
   @ add file will remain in all disk
   @ compute cost and storage cost

# restart now 
   @ same pubilc ip
   @ status was stopped
   @ vm still allocated
   @ at start of vm
   @ add file will remain in all disk
   @ compute cost and storage cost
 

# stop now
   @ vm deaiiocated
   @ temp file will be lost
   @ ip will be same
   @ after start azure may find another hardware and launch vm  
   @ only storage cost

#################################################################################################

# consept to allow load balancing to workload and increase resourse as per demand
  @ eg. vm running b2m ( 8gb 2cpu ) running at ponit
  @ as load increase vm scale set can addtional copies as per needs 
  @ also act as auto scaling
  @ scaling policy we have manual ( scaling by user), custom (auto scaling)

create vm scale set
1)~ search -> vm scale set -> create vm scale set ->
basics=> subcripoin () -> resourse group ()-> vm scale  set name (scale set) -> region (central india) ->
-> image (ubuntu) -> username () -> password () -> next -> 
spot => next -> disk => next ->
networking => interwork interface(select pen icon) -> public inbound rule port (ssh,http,https,rdp) pubilc ip (enable)-> 
load balancing  (none/azure load balancer/appication gateway) -> select load balancer (create load bancer) ->
-> load balancer name(test lb ) -> type (pubilc/internal) -> ptotocal ( tcp/udp) -> 
->scaling =>  inicical instance count (2) -> scaling policy (manual/custom) -> minimum instance () -> maximum instance () ->
-> scaling out= -> cpu threshold % (75) -> no. of instance increared by (1) -> 
-> scaling in= -> cpu threshold % (25) -> no. of instance decreared by (1) -> next ->
-> review + create 
  

# check 
@ 2 instance will be running
@ load balancer created and ip assigned

to log in certain instance in load balancer
~ load balancing -> load balancer -> (load balancer name) -> inbound nat rules -> find and use lb ip:frontend port for log in

######################################################################################################
# can create image of our own config
@ we can creating a custom image/vm from a already exited vm
@ once we create custom image we cant use it
@@ we should not use production vm for creation custom image
@ cost same as disk cost

create custom image
~ create a vm(windows/linux)  -> log in ->add some config ->
# steps below is for windows to deregister windows unique id or it will show error while creatinganother vm with already registered id
ctl+r -> sysprep -> enter -> double click sysprep -> enter system out of the box experiance ->
-> generalize -> shutdown -> ok(dont try this in personal / company laptop or will lost many data) => after the process complete the system will shutdown 
 
vm -> capture -> resource group -> name -> review + create => custom image will be created

###############################################################################################################
                                availability set
###############################################################################################################
availability
@ even if there is any failure or outage we can still access the resource
may be two types
# planned maintainance activity
@ maintainance , security etc  of the resources
@ azure notify custermer by email 
@ custermer can restart as per their time
@ if custemer didnt after certain time it will forced restart by itself

#un planned downtime
@ electonics may fail uncertainly
@ for example when cooling device is not working at a point as the electonics will increase heat when no cooling
@ heat indicator at a point of heat inidicate all server to shutdown un planedly

for this azure gives 2 solution
# availabiliity set
@ for high availability and fault tolorance
@ deploy more than one instance
@ it make sure vm not created on same server to avoid single point of failure
@ it gives two fault domain  and update domain
   @ fault domain :
   it place the vm in two diffent rack(where we mount server) as fault domain 0 (fd0), fault domain 1 (fd1) 
   max fd = 3, default = 2
   @ update domain
   couple of server from fd0,fd1 as ud0,ud1,ud2,ud3 etc
   max ud = 20, default = 5
 @ planed maintanance activity happens by ud order first will be ud0
 @ after restart ud may change in same fd
 @ however it only protect data at rack level if data center fail data in this case will be lost
place vm in avalaibility set
~ aziure ->vm -> create vm -> subcription -> rg -> name -> region -> avalibility options ( availibity set ) ->
availibity sets (name) => fault domain (2) +> update domain (5) -> ok ->.......=> review + create 
# create another vm in same region and av set
# check availibility + scaling 
# can see 1st vm in fd0 and ud0 and vm 2 in fd1 ,ud1 

availiability zones (az)
@ 2 or more vm shloud be there
@ availiability zones are ensure from data centre failure
@ not all region support availiability zones
@ each data was build at a certain distance
@ they have their own power,security, network etc to avoid single point of failure
@ data inter connection will be shere
@ 1 or 2data centre can called zone as zone1,zone2,zone3
@ we can use differnt zone for differnt vm
place vm in avalaibility zone
~ aziure ->vm -> create vm -> subcription -> rg -> name -> region -> avalibility options ( availibity zone) ->
availibility zone (zone1) -> ok ->.......=> review + create 
# create another vm in same region and av set

why  avalaibility set when availiability zones do its job
  @ not all region support availiability zone in that case we use avalaibility set which availible for all region
